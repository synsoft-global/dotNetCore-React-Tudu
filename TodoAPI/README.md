# .NET Todo List Web API 

This repo contains sample code in .net core using repository pattern on model first approach on entity framework. 
The code connects to SQL server database. 

# Instruction

Change the connection string in the project in appsettings.json.
Ensure migration commands are run to create database and the table.

## Building a sample

Build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Then run
these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:

```console
dotnet build

update-database

dotnet run
```

These will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run
the project respectively.

Multi-project samples have instructions in their root directory in
a `README.md` file.  

Except where noted, all samples build from the command line on
any platform supported by .NET Core. There are a few samples that are
specific to Visual Studio and require Visual Studio 2017 or later. In
addition, some samples show platform-specific features and will require
a specific platform. Other samples and snippets require the .NET Framework
and will run on Windows platforms, and will need the Developer Pack for
the target Framework version.
